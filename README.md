# FEniCS-Code

FEniCS-Code is a compilation of the personal codes that employed the Finite Element Framework "FEniCS".
At the moment, the repository consists of the following main folders

(1) FEniCS tutorials
    It provides the tutorials on how to solve PDEs with the Finite Element Framework FEniCS. These tutorials are 
    the outcome of the self-taught process and can be found in the textbook "Solving PDEs in Python" 
    by Langtangen Hans Petter and Logg Anders.
    
(2) Homogenization
    Several numerical examples of computational homogenization. It provides the code to deal with the following
    microscopic boundary value problems
    (2.a) Linear eletrostatics, namely linear Poisson equation
    (2.b) Homogenization of heterogenous materials of linear elasticity (linear materials and geometrically lienar)
    
(3) Hyperelasticity
    Numerical examples for deformations of 2D and 3D continuum bodies made of hyperelastic materials. The 
    corresponding boundary value problems are both materially and geometrically nonlinear.
